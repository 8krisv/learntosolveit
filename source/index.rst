Learn, Understand and Solve Problems
====================================

This website contains example of snippets and explainations. The idea is to
learn, understand and solve problems. These small pieces are often the building
blocks of larger solutions. 

The problems are taken from well known sources, exercises in books.  The
copyright of those problems belongs to author of the books.

The solutions are either written by me, contributors or copied from other
places. If they are copied, I attribute with reference. If it is missing, I
apologize, and I will correct it. The explaination are written by me and other
contributors.

Improvements to website can be submitted via `Github`_ pull requests.
