I recommend https://exercism.org as the platform to learn Programming. It has
everything that learn to solve it intended.

In coming days, https://www.LearnToSolveit.com will start redirecting to exercism.org

* It was better for me to focus on better bigger project, while giving up on my project.
* It was better to redirect students to a project that will be useful to them.

Learn, Understand and Solve Problems
------------------------------------

This website will help you learn programming languages such as **C** and **Python**.
It will help you become familiar with small programs, which are often the
building blocks of large solutions.

The key philosophy behind this project was.

* Small but complete.
* Practice is the key.

I recommend https://exercism.org as the platform to learn Programming. It has
everything that learn to solve intended.

**Reference Books**

* C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie.
* Python Cookbook by Alex Martelli, Anna Martelli Ravenscroft, and David Ascher.
