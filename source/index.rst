Learn, Understand and Solve Problems
====================================

This website will help you learn programming languages such as **C** and **Python**.
It will help you become familiar with small programs, which are often the
building blocks of large solutions.

The problems are from well known sources, exercises in popular books.  The
copyright of those problems belongs to author of the books.

The explainations are written by me or by other contributors.

Philosophy
---------

* Small but complete.
* Practice is the key.

Small but complete solutions help in learning with problem solving approach. If
a solution is shared as a building block of larger solution, a small, but
complete solution is shared.

Practice is key to solving problems. Links to practice the problem online is
shared so that students can practice their skills and **learn to solve it**.


Improvements to website can be submitted via `Github`_ pull requests.

**Reference Books**

* C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie.
* Python Cookbook by Alex Martelli, Anna Martelli Ravenscroft, and David Ascher.
